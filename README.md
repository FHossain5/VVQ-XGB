## Project Overview
The project develops a machine learning model to predict MOS for volumetric videos, which are compressed at various Quantization Parameter (QP) levels. The framework uses **XGBoost** for regression, incorporating statistical robustness measures and achieving high predictive accuracy. Key features include:
- **Dataset**: 1004 samples with features like QP, bitrate, PSNR, SSIM, VMAF, motion score, and spatial complexity.
- **Feature Engineering**: Added `bitrate_per_frame` and `vmaf_motion_interaction`.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: RMSE, R², Pearson, and Spearman correlations with bootstrapped confidence intervals.
- **Model Interpretability**: SHAP analysis for feature importance.
- **Generalization**: Tested across different video domains (compressed to dynamic backgrounds).

## Installation

## Data Collection and Preprocessing
### Data Collection
- **Source**: Human evaluators and technical measurement systems.
- **Features**:
  - Quantization Parameter (QP)
  - Frames per video
  - Bitrate
  - Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)
  - Structural Similarity Index (SSIM)
  - Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF)
  - Motion Score
  - Spatial Complexity
- **MOS Labels**: Collected via surveys and augmented with synthetic data.
- **Dataset Size**: Expanded from 159 to 1003 samples, balanced across MOS scale (1–5).

### Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Removed to ensure data quality.
- **Feature Scaling**: Applied `StandardScaler` for normalization.
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - `bitrate_per_frame = bitrate / frames`
  - `vmaf_motion_interaction = vmaf * motion_score`
- **MOS Label Processing**: Simulated feedback weighted by technical features, trimmed to [1, 5].

## Model Training
The model was trained using **XGBoost** with the following setup:
- **Algorithm**: XGBoost Regressor (version 3.0.0).
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation with early stopping (20 rounds).
- **Hyperparameters**:
  - `learning_rate`
  - `max_depth`
  - `n_estimators`
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - R² Score
  - Pearson Correlation
  - Spearman Correlation
- **Robustness**: Bootstrapped confidence intervals (1000 resamples).

The training code is available in `code/xgboost_mos_prediction.ipynb`.

## Results
The model demonstrates exceptional performance across simulated and real datasets, with the following metrics:

| Metric             | Simulated Score | Real Score | Interpretation                                      |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **RMSE**           | 0.0753          | 0.0755     | Predictions deviate by <0.08 MOS units, very accurate. |
| **R²**             | 0.9940          | 0.9942     | 99.4% of MOS variation captured, excellent explanatory power. |
| **Pearson**        | 0.9970          | 0.9971     | Near-perfect alignment with human ratings.         |
| **Spearman**       | 0.8503          | 0.8501     | Strong consistency in predicted vs. actual rankings. |

### Generalization Evaluation
The model was tested for generalization by training on compressed videos (black/grey backgrounds) and testing on dynamic videos (natural/colored backgrounds). Results are visualized below:

- **Metrics**:
  - RMSE: 0.0023
  - R²: 0.99998
  - Pearson: 0.99999
  - Spearman: 0.99963

### Baseline Comparisons
| Model              | R² Score | RMSE   |
|--------------------|----------|--------|
| Linear Regression  | 0.9813   | 0.0521 |
| Random Forest      | 0.9511   | 0.0837 |
| **XGBoost**        | 0.9942   | 0.0755 |

XGBoost outperforms simpler models, especially in handling non-linear patterns.

### Model Interpretability
- **SHAP Analysis**: Features like VMAF, SSIM, and PSNR have the strongest influence on MOS predictions.
- **Plots**: Summary Bar Plot and Beeswarm Plot (available in the original document).

### Error Analysis
- Residuals are normally distributed and centered around 0, indicating unbiased predictions.
- No significant underperformance across MOS ranges.
- RMSE < 0.08 meets high precision requirements.
